multi-protocol messaging and eventloop in C/C++ - experimental and educational

# Note about Licenses etc
This entire repo is full of experimental, learning, training and educational code, working with various messaging protocols.

There are references to some helpful tips found online, and there is some code copied from others. Those licenses would apply as is.

This code is MIT-licensed. You can use it in any which way you want. For some files, look at the top of the file for any
specific licenses.

I may add some more comments about the vaious directories.
